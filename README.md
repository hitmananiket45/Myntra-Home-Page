# Myntra-Home-Page
This project is a front-end replica of the popular e-commerce website Myntra, designed to showcase my skills in web development. The clone includes key features such as category navigation for Men, Women, Kids, Home & Living, and Beauty sections, as well as functional elements like a search bar, user profile, wishlist, and shopping bag icons. The design aims to capture the look and feel of the original Myntra website, making it a great demonstration of my abilities in HTML and CSS.

**Features:**
- Responsive navigation menu
- Dynamic content sections for different product categories
- Functional search bar and user account features
- Clean and modern UI design, closely matching the original Myntra website
